# jlcross

Dockerfiles to build Julia (binary/docker-image) for (some) Arm devices e.g. Raspberry Pi Series (also including Zero) using cross compilation.

# How to use

We will assume your build machine is Ubuntu 16.04 equipped with Intel CPU.

## Prepare environment

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
1. You will also need install [Docker Machine](https://github.com/docker/machine) to run  Docker image of balenalib.

## Try to run Julia

To prove Julia can run on arm devices We've uploaded Docker images on [Docker Hub repository named `jlcross`](https://hub.docker.com/r/terasakisatoshi/jlcross)

- Install docker image from Docker Hub.

```console
$ docker pull terasakisatoshi/jlcross:rpizero julia
Unable to find image 'terasakisatoshi/jlcross:rpizero' locally
rpizero: Pulling from terasakisatoshi/jlcross
(start to pull image...)

```

- Run Julia script using container

```console
$ cat hello.jl
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Example")
using Example
hello("World")
$ sudo docker run --rm -it $PWD:/work -w /work terasakisatoshi/jlcross:rpizero julia hello.jl

```

## Build Julia on your machine

- If you'd like to build Julia for your Raspberry Pi3, download `rpi3/Dockerfile` and the following command on your terminal to build Docker image including Julia binary:

```
sudo docker build -t jl4rpi3 .
```

Please be patient, it will take long time (within a half day) to build.

- Also see my gist:
  - [(gist) Build Julia for RaspberryPi Zero](https://gist.github.com/terasakisatoshi/3f8a55391b1fc22a5db4a43da8d92c98)
  - [Cross Compile Julia For RaspberryPi3 using Docker](https://gist.github.com/terasakisatoshi/00fa7d7b81b7c6748f2298f6ff65bf6e)



## Get binary from container

After building docker image(or pulling docker image from our Docker Hub repository), you can get Julia binary by copying it from docker container generated by docker image what you've got. What you have to do is:

```console
$ sudo docker create --name jltmp -it jl4rpi3 /bin/bash
$ sudo docker cp jltmp:/home/pi/work/julia-1.1.0 .
$ sudo docker stop jltmp
$ docker rm jltmp
$ ls # you will see julia-1.1.0 current directory of your build machine
julia-1.1.0
```

That's all.

# Limitation

I do not have aarch64 device Jetson-nano. So there is no guarantee it will work fine.
